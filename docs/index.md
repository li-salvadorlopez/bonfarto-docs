# Welcome to Bonfarto Docs

Bonfarto is a fictitious health care management system, the idea behind this project is to serve as a reference for 
many different architectural concepts, practices, patterns and technologies, to mention a few of them:
* Domain Driven Design
* Microservices
* Hexagonal architecture
* Behaviour Driven Development
* Spring framework ecosystem
* C4 Model and Structurizr
* Kubernates

## Motivation
While there are tons of repositories and projects that already have sample applications and sample code for many of these concepts, it was hard for me to find an example that will document the whole process of developing the application

* Design it using Domain Driven Design and Event Storming.
* Create microservices from the bounded contexts found on the event storming workshop.
* Structure the application using Hexagonal architecture to separate the domain model from the data model and view models.

and many other concepts, and the idea is that this project will have the settings that an application "close"

## The code
This is the repository that contains the source code of this application.
